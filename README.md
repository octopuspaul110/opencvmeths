# Simple Image Manipulation Scripts using OpenCV

# Overview:
This repository contains simple scripts for performing basic image manipulation tasks using the OpenCV library. OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision and image processing library that provides various functions for image manipulation, processing, and analysis.some of which includes:

# Scripts:
Resize.py: This script resizes input images to a specified width and height. It takes input images from a specified directory, resizes them, and saves the resized images to an output directory.

Rotate.py: This script rotates input images by a specified angle (in degrees). It takes input images from a directory, rotates them by the given angle, and saves the rotated images to an output directory.

Blur.py: This script applies Gaussian blur to input images to reduce noise and detail. It takes input images from a directory, applies Gaussian blur with a specified kernel size, and saves the blurred images to an output directory.

Threshold.py: This script applies thresholding to input grayscale images to create binary images. It takes input grayscale images from a directory, applies thresholding with a specified threshold value, and saves the binary images to an output directory.

EdgeDetection.py: This script detects edges in input images using the Canny edge detection algorithm. It takes input images from a directory, detects edges using the Canny algorithm with specified parameters, and saves the edge-detected images to an output directory.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenCV library (cv2)
NumPy library
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the desired script with appropriate arguments:
